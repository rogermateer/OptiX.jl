OptiX is intended to be a Swiss Army knife / versatile toolbox / kitchen sink of utilities for helping me on my journey from being a sentiment-driven investor to becoming a bounded-rational data-driven one.

As such, it will reflect my idiosyncratic learning experience, and not necessarily follow more well-trodden, received-wisdom, conventional approaches, even when these exist.
